# AI51-CampusReccomendations
This is a multi-platform app aimed at helping students seamlessly connect with events, clubs, and study groups that suit their interests. 

 “UTD is really what you make of it” This is certainly true and holds for our campus and other universities. Sometimes event announcements miss our radars and we miss out on really important networking opportunities or even fun sports games with new people. Often college students are discouraged from pursuing events later in the year and have a hard time getting in touch with club marketing and leadership. Fear no longer! Let's make UTD social again. 
Purpose: Our application will reduce the resistance between students and promote social activity to create a more vibrant and comfortable campus. By customizing the feed of students and creating tailored recommendations for study groups, clubs and events by specific attributes.
